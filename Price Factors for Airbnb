    Have you ever looked into traveling and thought "hotels are expensive and NOW Airbnbs are getting just as expensive." You aren't alone. It seemed like when 
Airbnb first started, the option was worth getting instead of a hotel if you could go without the amenities. Over the recent years, housing prices have increased 
rapidly and the change can be seen in Airbnb prices. Airbnb has its own role to play in increasing housing prices [1], people who can afford another house will buy 
it and rent it out to Airbnbers instead of traditional long-term renters. Since Airbnb is not as consistent as long-term renters the price per stay will go up in 
order to meet their mortgage needs and/or make a profit. It would be helpful to a traveler to know what factors will cause an increase in the price of an Airbnb. 

    Instead of looking at every Airbnb in every country, I will focus on one of the most expensive cities to live in and a popular tourist destination in the 
United State. The Seattle, Washington Airbnb dataset, this dataset was scraped on January 4, 2016, and available on Kaggle [2]. This dataset has a comprehensive 
range of data. A more refined and up-to-date dataset is available at Inside Airbnb [3]. In my analysis, two of the three available files were used. The listings file 
contains detailed information on each listing in the Seattle area by the listing id and the calendar file contains the listing date, listing id, availability, and 
price.

    So, what exactly should we be looking for in Airbnb to get the best price? A good start to help the average person traveling will be: What are the top 10 factors 
contributing to price, which zip code is the most expensive to live in, and which months are most expensive? The top 10 factors will be data from the listings file
which doesn't include the month. Spoiler alert zip code will not be in the top 10 factors but nether the less it is still an easy factor to look into when searching
for an Airbnb.

Through the mystery that is machine learning, I found that the top 10 factors that contribute to price in descending order are: 
   number of bedrooms, 
   weekly price, 
   number of bathrooms, 
   if the room type is an entire home or apartment,   
   accommodations, 
   cleaning fee, 
   reviews per month, 
   latitude, 
   availability 365,
   longitude. 
   
    If you are familiar with machine learning or interested to learn, the main tool that I used was random forests for their ability to return feature importance. 
Let us tackle the more subtle factors. The latitude and longitude were not input in their raw form aka near 47.6 degrees and 122.3 degrees but in the analysis, 
the data was centered around Seattle so each value was near 0 degrees. Therefore, the larger numbers in the raw form wouldn't drastically change the feature 
importance. The model was able to learn that the location was important, the latitude and longitude were indicators of how far the Airbnb was from the center
of Seattle. For reference, one degree of latitude is approximately 69 miles and one minute is 1.15 miles (one minute is the first place after the decimal). 
Longitude is a different story it varies since it converges on the poles [4]. 
    Accommodations is the variable for how many people can fit in the Airbnb, it is easy to see that the higher the accommodations the more likely a bigger 
party will choose this Airbnb and the more expensive it is going to be for the space. Other indicators of space are the number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and
if the room type is an entire home or apartment. Availability 365 is the only other variable we might question its relation to price. If the Airbnb is open to 
guests then there are more opportunities for it to fill up.

    Let's look at which zip codes are most expensive. Instead of looking at every zip code in Seattle (which seems to have more than average zip codes for its size),
I focused on the zip codes near central Seattle since this would be more than likely where a traveler would want to stay. 
    98101, $147.64
    98121, $133.36
    98104, $131.91
    98109, $117.90
    98119, $106.64
With the rest of the zipcodes going down towards $100. If you are not going to be in your Airbnb often during your trip then its best to avoid the top 4 zip codes.

If you are going to plan your trip to Seattle in advance then knowing the most expensive might be helpful. The top 3 most expensive months are June, July, and August. 
Averaging about to be about $150 compared to the least expensive month being January with an average price of $121. The weather being a huge factor in this, there 
is a trend of summer and fall being most expensive and winter and spring being least expensive.
