The libaries that are used in the project are pandas, sklearn, and math. 

Pandas' main object is the dataframe. It is compatible with numpy, a popular data analysis tool.
Pandas is a versatile library that allows you to read data from various file types, write to different file types, and even upload and pull data from databases. 
The dataframe are essentially tables that allow easy manipulated and allows for different types to be used, unlike in numpy which doesn't particular like different types
in its arrays.

Sklearn (Scikit-Learn) is a machine learning library. It contains an incredible number of different objects and tools to be used. This library has machine learning models
such as neural networks, linear models, random forests, and SVM to name a few.

Math is a library that contains mathematical formulas. 

The files used in this analysis are the Seattle airbnb dataset (available on Kaggle). Contained in this dataset are three different files, two of which I used. The first is a listings files
which contains a survey of the different listings on airbnb in 2016. The second file contains listing id numbers, the date the listing was on the website, the
availiability, and the price the listing.

The motivation of this analysis is that I am apart of a Udacity course that requires an analysis of dataset that can have business relevance.

Achknowledgements: Udacity and Kaggle.
